<p class="ui header product-top-header" title="The SeaPort Project Series Solution">For this set of projects for the course, we wish to simulate some of the aspects of a number of Sea Ports.Here are the classes and their instance variables we wish to define: SeaPortProgram extends JFrame o variables used by the GUI interface o world: World Thing implement Comparable &lt;Thing o index: int o name: String o parent: int World extends Thing o ports: ArrayList &lt;SeaPort o time: PortTime  SeaPort extends Thing o docks: ArrayList &lt;Dock o que: ArrayList &lt;Ship // the list of ships waiting to dock o ships: ArrayList &lt;Ship // a list of all the ships at this port o persons: ArrayList &lt;Person // people with skills at this port  Dock extends Thing o ship: Ship  Ship extends Thing o arrivalTime, dockTime: PortTime o draft, length, weight, width: double o jobs: ArrayList &lt;Job  PassengerShip extends Ship o numberOfOccupiedRooms: int o numberOfPassengers: int o numberOfRooms: int  CargoShip extends Ship o cargoValue: double o cargoVolume: double o cargoWeight: double  Person extends Thing o skill: String  Job extends Thing – optional till Projects 3 and 4 o duration: double o requirements: ArrayList &lt;String // should be some of the skills of the persons  PortTime o time: intEventually, in Projects 3 and 4, you will be asked to show the progress of the jobs using JProgressBar’s.

Here’s a very quick overview of all projects:

1. Read a data file, create the internal data structure, create a GUI to display the structure, and let the user search the structure. 2. Sort the structure, use hash maps to create the structure more efficiently. 3. Create a thread for each job, cannot run until a ship has a dock, create a GUI to show the progress of each job. 4. Simulate competing for resources (persons with particular skills) for each job.

<strong>Project 2 – Map class, Comparator, sorting</strong>

 Use the JDK Map class to write more efficient code when constructing the internal data structures from the data file.  Implement SORTING using the Comparator interface together with the JDK support for sorting data structures, thus sorting on different fields of the classes from Project 1.  Extend the GUI from Project 1 to let the user sort the data at run-time.

<strong>Documentation Requirements:</strong>

You should start working on a documentation file before you do anything else with these projects, and fill in items as you go along. Leaving the documentation until the project is finished is not a good idea for any number of reasons.The documentation should include the following (graded) elements: Cover page (including name, date, project, your class information)  Design o including a UML class diagram o classes, variables and methods: what they mean and why they are there o tied to the requirements of the project  User’s Guide o how would a user start and run your project o any special features o effective screen shots are welcome, but don’t overdo this  Test Plan o do this BEFORE you code anything o what do you EXPECT the project to do o justification for various data files, for example  Lessons Learned o express yourself here o a way to keep good memories of successes after hard work

Extend Project 1 to use advanced data structures and support sorting on various keys.1. Required data structure – the data structure specified in Project 1: a. World has SeaPort’s b. SeaPort has Dock’s, Ship’s, and Person’s c. Dock has a Ship d. Ship has Job’s e. PassengerShip f. CargoShip g. Person has a skill h. Job requires skills – optional until Project 3 i. PortTime 2. Use the HashMap class to support efficient linking of the classes used in Project 1. 1. The instances of the hash map class should be local to the readFile (Scanner) method. 2. These instances should be passed as explicit parameters to other methods used when reading the data file. 1. For example, the body of the methods like the following should be replaced to effectively use a &lt;Integer, Ship hash map, the surrounding code needs to support this structure: Ship getShipByIndex (int x, java.util.HashMap &lt;Integer, Ship hms) { return hms.get(x); } // end getDockByIndex 2. Since the body of this method has become trivial, perhaps the call to this method can be simply replaced by the get method of the HashMap. 3. Your code should be sure to handle a null return from this call gracefully. 3. The instances should be released (go out of scope, hence available for garbage collection) when the readFile method returns. 4. Comments: The idea here, besides getting some experience with an interesting JDK Collections class, is to change the operation of searching for an item with a particular index from an O(N) operation, ie searching through the entire data structure to see if the code can find the parent index parameter, to an O(1) operation, a hash map lookup. Of course, this isn’t so very interesting in such a small program, but consider what might happen with hundreds of ports, thousands of ships, and perhaps millions of persons and jobs. 5. Comments: Also, after the readFile operation, the indices are no longer interesting, and could be completely eliminated from the program. In this program, removing the index references could be accomplished by removing those variables from the parent class, Thing. 3. Implement comparators to support sorting: o ships in port que ArrayList’s by weight, length, width, draft within their port que o all items withing their ArrayList’s by name o OPTIONALLY: sorting by any other field that can be compared o The sorting should be within the parent ArrayList 4. Extend the GUI from Project 1 to allow the user to: o sort by the comparators defined above. 5. Again, the GUI elements should be distinct from the other classes in the program.

<strong>Project 3</strong>Introduction – the SeaPort Project seriesFor this set of projects for the course, we wish to simulate some of the aspects of a number of Sea Ports.Here are the classes and their instance variables we wish to define: SeaPortProgram extends JFrameo variables used by the GUI interfaceo world: World Thing implement Comparable &lt;Thing&gt;o index: into name: Stringo parent: int World extends Thingo ports: ArrayList &lt;SeaPort&gt;o time: PortTime SeaPort extends Thingo docks: ArrayList &lt;Dock&gt;o que: ArrayList &lt;Ship&gt; // the list of ships waiting to docko ships: ArrayList &lt;Ship&gt; // a list of all the ships at this porto persons: ArrayList &lt;Person&gt; // people with skills at this port Dock extends Thingo ship: Ship Ship extends Thingo arrivalTime, dockTime: PortTimeo draft, length, weight, width: doubleo jobs: ArrayList &lt;Job&gt; PassengerShip extends Shipo numberOfOccupiedRooms: into numberOfPassengers: into numberOfRooms: int CargoShip extends Shipo cargoValue: doubleo cargoVolume: doubleo cargoWeight: double Person extends Thingo skill: String Job extends Thing – optional till Projects 3 and 4o duration: doubleo requirements: ArrayList &lt;String&gt; // should be some of the skills of the persons PortTimeo time: intEventually, in Projects 3 and 4, you will be asked to show the progress of the jobs using JProgressBar’s.2Here’s a very quick overview of all projects:1. Read a data file, create the internal data structure, create a GUI to display the structure, and let the user search the structure.2. Sort the structure, use hash maps to create the structure more efficiently.3. Create a thread for each job, cannot run until a ship has a dock, create a GUI to show the progress of each job.4. Simulate competing for resources (persons with particular skills) for each job.Project 3 General ObjectivesProject 3 – More JDK classes – GUI’s and threads Explore other GUI classes, such as JTree, JTable, and JProgressBar. Create and run threadso Competing for one resource.Documentation Requirements:You should start working on a documentation file before you do anything else with these projects, and fill in items as you go along. Leaving the documentation until the project is finished is not a good idea for any number of reasons.The documentation should include the following (graded) elements: Cover page (including name, date, project, your class information) Designo including a UML class diagramo classes, variables and methods: what they mean and why they are thereo tied to the requirements of the project User’s Guideo how would a user start and run your projecto any special featureso effective screen shots are welcome, but don’t overdo this Test Plano do this BEFORE you code anythingo what do you EXPECT the project to doo justification for various data files, for example Lessons Learnedo express yourself hereo a way to keep good memories of successes after hard work3Project 3 Specific Goals:Implement threads and a GUI interface using advanced Java Swing classes.1. Required data structure specified in Project 1:1. World has SeaPort’s2. SeaPort has Dock’s, Ship’s, and Person’s3. Dock has a Ship4. Ship has Job’s5. PassengerShip6. CargoShip7. Person has a skill 8. Job requires skills- NEW CLASS for this project!9. PortTime2. Extend Project 2 to use the Swing class JTree effectively to display the contents of the data file. o (Optional) Implement a JTable to also show the contents of the data file. There are lots of options here for extending your program.3. Threads: o Implement a thread for each job representing a task that ship requires.o Use the synchronize directive to avoid race conditions and insure that a dock is performing the jobs for only one ship at a time. the jobs of a ship in the queue should not be progressing when all the jobs for a ship are done, the ship should leave the dock, allowing a ship from the que to dock once the ship is docked, the ships jobs should all progress in Project 4, the jobs will also require persons with appropriate skills.o The thread for each job should be started as the job is read in from the data file.o Use delays to simulate the progress of each job.o Use a JProgressBar for each job to display the progress of that job.o Use JButton’s on the Job panel to allow the job to be suspended or cancelled.4. As before, the GUI elements should be distinct (as appropriate) from the other classes in the program.5. See the code at the end of this posting for some suggestions.Suggestions for Project 3 Job class. Here is a sample of code for a Job class in another context, the Sorcerer’s Cave project. The code for this class will need some modifications, but this should give you an idea of the issues involved. In fact, you should find much of this code redundant.Also, some of the code at the following sites might give you some ideas about how to proceed with this project: Project 3 Example – Sorcerer’s Cave, note that even this one isn’t complete run method – detailed analysis of the run method in the Job class in the Cave project// j:&lt;index&gt;:&lt;name&gt;:&lt;creature index&gt;:&lt;time&gt;[:&lt;required artifact type&gt;:&lt;number&gt;]* class Job extends CaveElement implements Runnable { static Random rn = new Random ();4JPanel parent; Creature worker = null; int jobIndex; long jobTime; String jobName = “”; JProgressBar pm = new JProgressBar (); boolean goFlag = true, noKillFlag = true; JButton jbGo = new JButton (“Stop”); JButton jbKill = new JButton (“Cancel”); Status status = Status.SUSPENDED; enum Status {RUNNING, SUSPENDED, WAITING, DONE}; public Job (HashMap &lt;Integer, CaveElement&gt; hmElements, JPanel cv, Scanner sc) { parent = cv; sc.next (); // dump first field, j jobIndex = sc.nextInt (); jobName = sc.next (); int target = sc.nextInt (); worker = (Creature) (hmElements.get (target)); jobTime = sc.nextInt (); pm = new JProgressBar (); pm.setStringPainted (true); parent.add (pm); parent.add (new JLabel (worker.name, SwingConstants.CENTER)); parent.add (new JLabel (jobName , SwingConstants.CENTER)); parent.add (jbGo); parent.add (jbKill); jbGo.addActionListener (new ActionListener () { public void actionPerformed (ActionEvent e) { toggleGoFlag (); } }); jbKill.addActionListener (new ActionListener () { public void actionPerformed (ActionEvent e) { setKillFlag (); } }); new Thread (this).start(); } // end constructor // JLabel jln = new JLabel (worker.name); // following shows how to align text relative to icon // jln.setHorizontalTextPosition (SwingConstants.CENTER);5// jln.setHorizontalAlignment (SwingConstants.CENTER); // parent.jrun.add (jln); public void toggleGoFlag () { goFlag = !goFlag; } // end method toggleRunFlag public void setKillFlag () { noKillFlag = false; jbKill.setBackground (Color.red); } // end setKillFlag void showStatus (Status st) { status = st; switch (status) { case RUNNING: jbGo.setBackground (Color.green); jbGo.setText (“Running”); break; case SUSPENDED: jbGo.setBackground (Color.yellow); jbGo.setText (“Suspended”); break; case WAITING: jbGo.setBackground (Color.orange); jbGo.setText (“Waiting turn”); break; case DONE: jbGo.setBackground (Color.red); jbGo.setText (“Done”); break; } // end switch on status } // end showStatus public void run () { long time = System.currentTimeMillis(); long startTime = time; long stopTime = time + 1000 * jobTime; double duration = stopTime – time; synchronized (worker.party) { // party since looking forward to P4 requirements while (worker.busyFlag) { showStatus (Status.WAITING); try { worker.party.wait(); } catch (InterruptedException e) { } // end try/catch block6} // end while waiting for worker to be free worker.busyFlag = true; } // end sychronized on worker while (time &lt; stopTime &amp;&amp; noKillFlag) { try { Thread.sleep (100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {} if (goFlag) { showStatus (Status.RUNNING); time += 100; pm.setValue ((int)(((time – startTime) / duration) * 100)); } else { showStatus (Status.SUSPENDED); } // end if stepping } // end runninig pm.setValue (100); showStatus (Status.DONE); synchronized (worker.party) { worker.busyFlag = false; worker.party.notifyAll (); } } // end method run – implements runnable public String toString () { String sr = String.format (“j:%7d:%15s:%7d:%5d”, jobIndex, jobName, worker.index, jobTime); return sr; } //end method toString } // end class JobDeliverables:1.

Project 4 – Concurrency Resource poolso Threads competing for multiple resources Blocking threads Extending the GUI interface to visualize the resource pools and progress of the various threads.Documentation Requirements:You should start working on a documentation file before you do anything else with these projects, and fill in items as you go along. Leaving the documentation until the project is finished is not a good idea for any number of reasons.The documentation should include the following (graded) elements: Cover page (including name, date, project, your class information) Designo including a UML class diagramo classes, variables and methods: what they mean and why they are thereo tied to the requirements of the project User’s Guideo how would a user start and run your projecto any special featureso effective screen shots are welcome, but don’t overdo this Test Plano do this BEFORE you code anythingo what do you EXPECT the project to doo justification for various data files, for example Lessons Learnedo express yourself hereo a way to keep good memories of successes after hard work3Project 4 Specific Goals:Extend project 3 to include making jobs wait until people with the resources required by the job are available at the port.Elaboration:1. Reading Job specifications from a data file and adding the required resources to each Job instance.2. Resource pools – SeaPort.ArrayList &lt;Person&gt; list of persons with particular skills at each port, treated as resource pools, along with supporting assignment to ships and jobs.3. Job threads – using the resource pools and supporting the concept of blocking until required resources are available before proceeding.4. The Job threads should be efficient:1. If the ship is at a dock and all the people with required skills are available, the job should start.2. Otherwise, the Job should not hold any resources if it cannot progress.3. Use synchronization to avoid race conditions.4. Each Job thread should hold any required synchronization locks for a very short period.5. When a job is over, all the resources used by the job (the people) should be released back to the port.6. When all the jobs of a ship are done, the ship should depart the dock and if there are any ships in the port que, one of then should should be assigned to the free dock, and that ships jobs can now try to progress.7. NOTE: If a job can never progress because the port doesn’t have enough skills among all the persons at the port, the program should report this and cancel the job.5.
